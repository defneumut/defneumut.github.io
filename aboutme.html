	<p>My name is Defne Umut KÃ¶se, i live in Turkey. I'm a third grade computer engineering student at Anadolu University. I dont have enough interest to my department but im trying to gain it. You are reading my Internet Programing homework which is the first homework that i done all myself(i mean i didnt need help and i understand everything). I'm kind of proud of with this result.</p>
	<p>By the way im from Corum thats why i pick Corum for this homework. I dont like Corum that much but i like the history of this city.</p>
	<p>Let me talk about myself more. I care about nature, animals and people. I think respect and understanding are the most important things in life. I have a kind of different sense of aesthetic. I dont really care about what general thoughts, patterns or borders are. I just like what i like :p. Oh also i really love eating(anything, fastfood, slowfood :P... i mean its a huge range of foods that i like to eat), i wish i dont gain weight but..Hello realism.</p>
